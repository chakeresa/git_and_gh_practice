My most interesting trips have been to India. My brother is married to an Indian woman, and when they were first married, they lived in Bangalore for a few years. So my mom and I visited them in Bangalore and travelled around the country a bit. I loved how colorful and bustling everything was, even in the small towns. The food was delicious (albeit hard to handle spicy food consistently for every meal for 2 weeks). There was so much unfamiliar stuff going on that it was constantly exciting & overwhelming. Very interesting to see how other people live and have their own "normal".
